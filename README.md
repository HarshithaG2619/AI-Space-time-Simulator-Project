## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have a modern web browser that supports WebGL (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2.  Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
3.  Open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
    *   Alternatively, if you are using a local web server (like VS Code's Live Server), serve the project directory and navigate to `index.html`.
+   *   Another simple way to serve the project locally is using Python's built-in HTTP server:
+       1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
+       2.  Navigate to the project directory (`cd path/to/spacetime-simulator`).
+       3.  If you have Python 3, run: `python -m http.server`
+       4.  If you have Python 2, run: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
+       5.  Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000` (or the port specified by the server).
